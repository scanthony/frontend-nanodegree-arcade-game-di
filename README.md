# Arcade Game Clone
A Udacity Front-End Dev. Project 

## How to Play this Game?
Press the arrow keys to move the player and avoid crashing with the bugs. 
If you finally reached the river on the top of the screen, you will gain one more life. However, the speed the bugs run will also increase. 
When all your lives are lost, the game will then be over.
